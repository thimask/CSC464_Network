This progam transfers file from Client to Server using Selective repeat UDP with poll library inducted

there is a multiclient server
As client connects to server; it creates a Forked process
Main server goes to recv again on the socket as given
and child process, closes main socket. and then get a random port between 41000 to 42000

Server tries to open a file in write mode
if ok"sends ok " else NAK

Client reads chunks of data from file and adds in window
if ok. then sends the file to the server

As file is completed. It acknowlege the server..

Server on other hand, 
If packet seq number is same as window lower, it will accept the packet and slide window
If it goes to recv packet for 10 times with a poll wait of 1 second. it will exit child process

I have used malloc; because its faster to use
